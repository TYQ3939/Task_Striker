# Task_Striker
This is an assignment I had done with my university groupmates in 2023 during our Foundation. It's a program demo that connects Clients with skilled Pros to solve their tasks, projects, and works. It contains several features like account creation, profile management, Pros searching/browsing, chat demo, simple payment demo, etc.
